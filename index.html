        At the age when space was only limited to Pluto
        I had aspired to become a renowned astrophysicist
        Space was not just word for me, it was a limitless mystery ready to be unravelled
        Since a young age I decided to pursue science, with the mindset to solve the mysteries of time
        I participated in Science and Math olympiad that challenged my potential and testing my critical thinking.
        Currently I am pursuing Chemical engineering.

        Coding was part of my life since the age of 12.i wanted to make my own games but there came a point when I started to prepare for my board exams n JEE exams where I couldn't focus much on coding. But the best part is just after all these exams, I started coding again and explored the various other paths that I was unaware of. now i can say i know 2 languages and 2 markup languages.
